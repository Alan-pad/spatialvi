```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
#| echo: false

input_adata = None
cluster_resolution = 1  # Resolution for Leiden clustering
n_hvgs = 2000  # Number of HVGs to use for analyses
output_anndata = None
```

The data has already been filtered in the _quality controls_ reports and is
saved in the AnnData format:

```{python}
#| warning: false
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from umap import UMAP
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
```

```{python}
st_adata = sc.read("./" + input_adata)
st_adata
```

# Normalization

Before we can continue working on the data it needs to be normalized. We here
use the built-in `normalize_total` method from [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
followed by a log-transformation.

```{python}
sc.pp.normalize_total(st_adata, inplace=True)
sc.pp.log1p(st_adata)
```

# Feature selection

Not all features (genes, in this case) are informative, and selecting for a
subset of the total features is commonly done prior to clustering. By selecting
the most variable genes in a dataset we can capture those most important in
regards to yielding a good separation of clusters.

```{python}
# layout-nrow: 1
# Find top HVGs and print results
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(st_adata, flavor="seurat", n_top_genes=n_hvgs)
var_genes_all = st_adata.var.highly_variable
print("Extracted highly variable genes: %d"%sum(var_genes_all))

# Plot the HVGs
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (4.5, 4.5)
sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(st_adata)
```

# Clustering

To uncover the underlying structure of the transcriptional landscape, we perform
manifold embedding and clustering based on transcriptional similarity. Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce dimensionality, and UMAP (Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection) is used for visualization. The Leiden
algorithm is employed for clustering with a given resolution.

```{python}
sc.pp.pca(st_adata)
sc.pp.neighbors(st_adata)
sc.tl.umap(st_adata)
sc.tl.leiden(st_adata, key_added="clusters", resolution=cluster_resolution)
Markdown(f"Resolution for Leiden clustering: `{cluster_resolution}`")
```

## All clusters

We then generate UMAP plots to visualize the distribution of clusters:

```{python}
#| warning: false
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (7, 7)
sc.pl.umap(st_adata, color="clusters")
```

## Counts and genes

We can also visualise the total counts and the genes with at least 1 count in
the UMAP:

```{python}
# Make plots of UMAP of ST spots clusters
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (3.5, 3.5)
sc.pl.umap(st_adata, color=["total_counts", "n_genes_by_counts"])
```

## Individual clusters

An additional visualisation is to show where the various spots are in each
individual cluster while ignoring all other cluster:

```{python}
sc.tl.embedding_density(st_adata, basis="umap", groupby="clusters")
sc.pl.embedding_density(st_adata, groupby="clusters", ncols=2)
```

# Spatial visualisation

Next, we examine how total counts and the number of detected genes behave in
spatial coordinates by overlaying the spots on the tissue image itself.

```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 2
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (8, 8)
sc.pl.spatial(st_adata, img_key="hires", color="total_counts", size=1.25)
sc.pl.spatial(st_adata, img_key="hires", color="n_genes_by_counts", size=1.25)
```

To gain insights into tissue organization and potential inter-cellular
communication, we visualize the spatial distribution of clusters on the image.
Spots belonging to the same cluster in gene expression space often co-occur in
spatial dimensions, providing valuable information about the spatial
organization of cells.

```{python}
# TODO: Can the colour bar on this figure be fit to the figure?
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (7, 7)
sc.pl.spatial(st_adata, img_key="hires", color="clusters", size=1.25)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
if output_anndata is not None:
    st_adata.write(output_anndata)
```
